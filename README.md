# RoomBooking App 

Implementation done according to [these guidelines](https://challenges.1aim.com/roombooking_app/).

## Disclaimer

* I've not implemented tests as I've said (by email) to implement the rest of the app on saturday evening (21/08/16), and spent all night working  on cool features and UI. It was not specified on the challenge description, so I didn't apply special concern on it. Nevertheless it's my policy to create tests for software whenever I have the chance.

## To Test the app
Download apk [here!](https://github.com/carloscorreia94/1aimRoomBookingApp/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk)

* Go to Phone Settings -> Security -> Enable Apps from Unknown Sources
* You're all set :-)


## Not Implemented

* SendPasses Check for duplicates and real phone numbers (only accepting numbers with more than 8 chars)
* Timeline is not implemented - sent statically from 12h to 23h
* One Hour Filter is partly implemented (commented) - I needed to get some sleep to be able to think on how to combine both filters properly ...
